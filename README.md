# Visualizing Data: From Generation to Insight

This project focuses on generating data and creating visually appealing and functional visualizations using powerful tools like Matplotlib and Plotly. The journey includes accessing data from online sources, plotting weather data, and mapping global earthquake activity. 
Additionally, a program will be developed to automatically download and visualize data. These skills are essential for exploring the high-demand field of data science and will provide a solid foundation for further exploration and application in real-world scenarios.
